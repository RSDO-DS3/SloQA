                "text" : "Manchester United did make an ambitious bid to sign Barcelona forward Neymar in the summer, according to the Brazil international's father. It has been widely reported that Louis van Gaal attempted to bring the 23-year-old to Old Trafford in the final weeks of the transfer window, with Neymar admitting that there had been discussions about a possible switch. Manchester United's desperate scramble for new striker after allowing Robin van Persie, Radamel Falcao and Javier Hernandez to all leave the club, led to them being linked with a host of players, including Bayern Munich forward Thomas Muller. United eventually parted with £36million for French teenager Anthony Martial from Monaco but, according to Neymar's father Neymar da Silva Santos, only after they had failed with a bid to lure his son away from the Nou Camp.\n@highlight\nManchester United were widely reported to have bid for Neymar in summer\n@highlight\nThe player's father has confirmed that the Old Trafford club did make offer\n@highlight\nThe Brazil international is ready to open talks over a new deal at Barcelona",

Customers with RBS, Nationwide, NatWest, Santander, Ulster Bank and MBNA can use the service from today. HSBC, which was expected to be one of the first banks to launch the service, said instead it would not launch it until the end of July. The bank's customers vented their frustration on Twitter.

Former Arsenal striker, Wright, added that 23-year-old Wilshere no longer has the pace he once did as a teenager and will therefore continue to 'get into trouble' making marauding runs forward.

Turf Moor was bouncing as Boyd lashed home a poor clearance from returning City captain Vincent Kompany after 61 minutes. And Manuel Pellegrini's men – who sent on £50million substitutes Wilfried Bony and Stevan Jovetic to try and salvage the game – were lucky to survive with 11 men after bad challenges from Sergio Aguero and Martin Demichelis. CLICK HERE to read Sportsmail's Joe Bernstein's full match report from Turf Moor. Host commentator What a potential season-defining moment Burnley's win could be tonight. The victory still sees the Clarets in the relegation zone - but by only one point with Sunderland looking over their shoulders ever-more. Meanwhile the defeat for City is damaging for their title hopes. A win for Chelsea on Sunday would see Manuel Pellegrini's side trail by eight points with nine games remaining.

The police also accused Smith of physical assault and using offensive language. Race relations had been growing more tense over the year as Newark Mayor Hugh Addonizio announced a series of decisions that had angered the African-American community. Some of the residents who were living across the street from where the arrest took place walked out of their homes to watch the incident. Smith was badly beaten. As the police hauled him to the Fourth Precinct station, word spread within the community about what was happening. African-American taxi drivers sent out reports through their radios. A crowd slowly gathered to monitor and protest Smith's treatment. Word quickly spread about the arrest and what was taking place inside the station.\n@highlight\nJulian Zelizer: On July 12, 1967, riots erupted in Newark, New Jersey, after an African-American man was pulled over and beaten by two white policemen\n@highlight\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the riots is a reminder that we still face some of the same issues of racism in policing and criminal justice, writes Zelizer",

Overall, 49% say they favor the 2010 health care law, more formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, while 47% oppose it. Though a mostly mixed review overall, that's a sharp improvement compared with previous polling on the law. More have opposed than favored the law in every CNN/ORC poll on this question from March 2010 until now. The shift in the law's favor stems largely from Democrats and independents, while views among Republicans haven't moved much.\n@highlight\n49% say they favor the 2010 health care law\n@highlight\nBut few feel the ACA has done much to help them personally",

FBI agents questioned Gulet Mohamed after his plane landed at Dulles International Airport in suburban Washington early Friday, said his attorney, Gadeir Abbas. That questioning ended, and the teen was subsequently cleared through customs. Mohamed's family greeted him with balloons and a dozen roses. Mohamed's lawyers argued that as a U.S. citizen, Mohamed had a right to be in the United States, and that the government had provided no reason for including him on the no-fly list. Federal prosecutors later told a judge they were making arrangements to allow the teenager to return to the United States.\n@highlight\nNEW: Gulet Mohamed is questioned by FBI, met by family at Dulles International Airport\n@highlight\nMohamed, 19, is suing the U.S. government over the alleged detention.\n@highlight\nMohamed had been trapped in Kuwait for nearly a month\n@highlight\nMohamed went to the Mideast to visit relatives and to learn Arabic, according to the lawsuit",

Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton tops Bernie Sanders by 18 points in the state's Democratic primary, which will be held a week later. In the Republican race, Trump, at 38%, tops Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who holds second place with 22%. Behind those two, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio garners 14% support, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is at 10%, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson has 6% and Ohio Gov. John Kasich is at 4%. Trump's lead is bolstered by widespread perceptions of him as the candidate best able to handle the economy, immigration and ISIS, and further, that he has the best chance to win in November and would be most likely to change the way things work in Washington.\n@highlight\nIn the Republican race, Trump, at 38%, tops Texas Sen.

Within hours, Clinton's political director, Amanda Renteria, took to Twitter saying Clinton \"meant no disrespect to Native Americans.\"\n@highlight\nSimon Moya-Smith: Clinton's use \"off the reservation,\" shows Americans' casual racism to Native Americans\n@highlight\nHe says Trump doesn't help when he says \"Indians have gone wild' over her usage",

Ben Sasse of Nebraska announced Tuesday he will campaign with two of Donald Trump's rivals for the Republican presidential nomination, just two days after he chastised Trump for his marital infidelities. As part of an 18-tweet spree on Sunday night, Sasse asked Trump whether he has \"repented\" for his \"many affairs w/ married women.\" \"@realDonaldTrump Q4: You brag abt many affairs w/ married women. Have you repented? To harmed children & spouses? Do you think it matters?\" Sasse asked Trump in a tweet that was retweeted more than 700 times. The tweets came after Trump attended church services in Iowa on Sunday morning. Entering the final stretch in Iowa, where evangelicals are a key portion of the Republican primary electorate, Trump has played up his Christianity and turned to supporters like Jerry Falwell Jr. to boost his religious bona fides.\n@highlight\nSunday night, Nebraska Sen.

He’s certainly got all the qualities that make him the perfect replacement for the Liverpool captain. I appreciate that Jordan Henderson is set to take over as skipper, but in terms of dynamism, energy and quality, Lallana looks like the perfect replacement for Gerrard the player. Have a look at Sunday’s victory over Manchester City: Lallana started the game as one of two No 10s behind Raheem Sterling (Brendan Rodgers’ innovative approach as a coach should not be underestimated). When Lazar Markovic went off, Lallana went over to the right wing, and then when Alberto Moreno was substituted, Lallana ended the game on the left wing.\n@highlight\nLiverpool beat champions Manchester City 2-1 on Sunday\n@highlight\nEngland midfielder Adam Lallana excelled in three different positions\n@highlight\nLiverpool captain Steven Gerrard is leaving the club at end of the season\n@highlight\nLallana looks the perfect replacement for Gerrard\n@highlight\nREAD: Jordan Henderson confident Liverpool can finish above Man City\n@highlight\nCLICK HERE for all the latest Liverpool news",

Susanna Martinez for disparaging comments he's made about them in the past. \"I have been a Republican all my life,\" said Dole, who endorsed former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush at one point during the 2016 primary fight but has since backed Trump. \"The party has done a lot for me. I hope I've done a lot for the party along the way. But when Donald Trump clinched the Republican nomination, it was an easy call for me. What's a lifelong Republican supposed to do, support the opponent? I don't think so.\"\n@highlight\n\"What's a lifelong Republican supposed to do, support the opponent?

Robin van Persie's arrival at Manchester United was followed by a glut of goals that justified Alex Ferguson's $38 million investment in the former Arsenal striker. Hernandez also made a big impact two years ago as a relatively little-known signing from Guadalajara, being named player of the season as United won a record 19th league title. But last season was a different story as the Mexico international played a bit-part role and the club's Premier League crown was snatched by crosstown rivals Manchester City. The 24-year-old came into the 2012-13 campaign fresh after Ferguson demanded he miss Mexico's successful Olympic campaign, but he has started only five matches out of 16 in all competitions.\n@highlight\nJavier Hernandez comes off the bench to inspire Manchester United to victory\n@highlight\nMexican scores twice and has another effort deflected in by Aston Villa player\n@highlight\nThe 3-2 win puts United four points clear at the top of the Premier League\n@highlight\nArsenal lose more ground after blowing a two-goal lead for the second time this week",

That match laid the groundwork for the visit of U.S. President Richard Nixon in 1972 and ultimately paved the way for the establishment of diplomatic ties in 1979, ending China's isolation from the outside world.\n@highlight\nChinese table tennis legend Zhuang Zedong has died aged 73\n@highlight\nHe was key figure in \"ping pong diplomacy\" that helped thaw ties between China, U.S.\n@highlight\nU.S.-China table tennis match led to 1972 visit by U.S. President Richard Nixon",

But he took a leave of absence from the team in September after complications arose during his treatment, which included chemotherapy. He had been hospitalized for more than a month.

Prince's half-brother, Duane Nelson, said he used to get the drug for Prince to help him come down after shows, Michael B. Padden said. \"Duane told me that he witnessed him taking the drugs and he also procured Percocet for him,\" Padden said. Nelson was adamant that Prince was in no way just a recreational user, Padden said. He started using the drug to help him deal with the rigors of performing. Another half-sibling, Lorna Nelson, confirmed Prince's drug use but was not involved in getting drugs for him, Padden said. She died in 2006.\n@highlight\nLawyer says Prince's half-brother told him Prince was addicted to Percocet decades ago\n@highlight\nDay before he died, addiction specialist launched \"life-saving mission,\" lawyer says",

City’s fears that Pogba could end up at Barcelona next year were confirmed Wednesday when two senior representatives of the Spanish club, Ariedo Braida and Albert Soler, met with Juve’s managing director Giuseppe Marotta and sporting director Fabio Paratici at a Milan restaurant. Marotta later confirmed that a bid of £56.7million had been received for Pogba, but insisted the 22-year-old France midfielder would not be sold. Although Barcelona cannot sign any players until a transfer embargo is lifted in January, and will not know the identity of their club president until an election on July 18, it is understood that they want to put a deal in place for Pogba to remain in Turin next season and then move to the Nou Camp in a year’s time.\n@highlight\nBarcelona and Juventus officials have met to talk about Paul Pogba\n@highlight\nJuventus are eager to keep Pogba from Barcelona and Manchester City\n@highlight\nCity are keen on signing Kevin De Bruyne from German club Wolfsburg",

He has just wrapped up his 10th visit to the Middle East in pursuit of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority -- the most elusive prize in international diplomacy. Kerry has a vision, according to U.S. diplomats -- to climb the mountain with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, and to peer down from the summit on the valley of peace to see what a two-state solution would look like. It is a poetic metaphor, but more than half-way into the nine-month timetable for reaching a framework agreement, Kerry's partners are still bickering in the foothills. The more pessimistic observers -- with history on their side -- say both the Israelis and Palestinians are positioning themselves to be able to blame the other for failure.\n@highlight\nThrough intensive diplomacy the U.S. Secretary of State is trying to build momentum in Middle East peace talks\n@highlight\nBorders and Jewish settlements are likely to be the most difficult piece of Kerry's puzzle\n@highlight\nSome within Israel's coalition government want to annex Jewish settlements in the fertile Jordan Valley",

The multi-million-pound development at the Hilton Hotel in Park Lane, Central London, will enable clients to enjoy a cigarette and gamble at the same time, and is expected to be particularly popular with wealthy clients who find the ban on smoking in enclosed public spaces irksome. The move will see a return to the days of Dr No, when Sean Connery as 007 meets the voluptuous Sylvia Trench at Le Cercle club, languidly puts a Morland cigarette to his lips and introduces himself with the immortal line: ‘Bond. James Bond.’\n@highlight\nOutdoor casino earmarked for Hilton Hotel in Park Lane, Central London\n@highlight\nCasino clients will be able to enjoy a cigarette and gamble at the same time\n@highlight\nGaming tables will be placed on a new roof garden extension at the hotel\n@highlight\nHilton Park Lane Casino opened last year with membership costing £1,000",

The payment ends Tripoli's legal liability in U.S. terror cases and paves the way for increased U.S. involvement in the oil-rich nation. President Bush signed an executive order Friday restoring Libyan immunity from terrorism-related lawsuits and dismissing pending cases over compensation as part of a deal reached this summer.

On the restaurant's website it is described as 'Australia's most popular take away food shop known for its quality services'. However, an inspection found conditions were far from 'quality.' The Sunshine Coast Council inspected the property and told Caloundra Magistrates Court how they found cockroaches in the kitchen, stoves caked in grease, dirty worktops, walls and fixtures. The Brisbane Times reported that inspectors also said food was 'poorly stored and likely to be easily contaminated', while they also found old rusty shelving inside the cool rooms and freezers.\n@highlight\nCentrepoint Buffet in Caloundra fined for poor hygiene standards\n@highlight\nSunshine Coast Council found workplaces dirty and cockroaches\n@highlight\nOwner angry that evidence released months after improvements",

The Vatican said the document, obtained in draft form by the Italian magazine l'Espresso, was not the final version, which will remain under embargo until its release on Thursday. One Vatican official called the breach 'heinous'.\n@highlight\nPope Francis's encyclical on climate change leaked four days early\n@highlight\nThe 192-page draft was put on the website of Italian magazine L'Espresso\n@highlight\nThe Vatican said it was not the final version and condemned 'heinous' act\n@highlight\nPope Francis to call for a stop to climate change and global inequality\n@highlight\nDue to send encyclical to Catholic bishops around the world on Thursday",

Moments before her arrest by ICE, Vargas had advocated for young people who, like herself, were brought to the US illegally as children, then qualified for a temporary reprieve from deportation under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA. Recipients often are called DREAMers, a reference to the DREAM Act, which if approved by Congress would give DACA participants permanent legal status.\n@highlight\nImmigrant from Argentina says she was brought to United States at age 7\n@highlight\nFinancial troubles kept her from renewing her DACA status, friend says",

                "text" : "(CNN) On the hot summer night on of July 12, 1967, two white policemen in Newark, New Jersey, arrested an African-American cabdriver named John Smith for \"tailgating\" and driving in the wrong direction. The police also accused Smith of physical assault and using offensive language. Race relations had been growing more tense over the year as Newark Mayor Hugh Addonizio announced a series of decisions that had angered the African-American community. Some of the residents who were living across the street from where the arrest took place walked out of their homes to watch the incident. Smith was badly beaten. As the police hauled him to the Fourth Precinct station, word spread within the community about what was happening. African-American taxi drivers sent out reports through their radios. A crowd slowly gathered to monitor and protest Smith's treatment. Word quickly spread about the arrest and what was taking place inside the station.\n@highlight\nJulian Zelizer: On July 12, 1967, riots erupted in Newark, New Jersey, after an African-American man was pulled over and beaten by two white policemen\n@highlight\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the riots is a reminder that we still face some of the same issues of racism in policing and criminal justice, writes Zelizer",

It's true that under Article I, Section 8, Congress has the power to declare war, tax and spend for defense, and provide for our armed forces.

Walter Shaub, who served as ethics director under the Obama administration, said Conway likely violated the Hatch Act, which prohibits White House officials from advocating for or against candidates, even in media interviews. Speaking to Fox News Monday, Conway addressed the heated Alabama race and Moore's Democratic competitor, saying, \"Doug Jones in Alabama, folks, don't be fooled. He will be a vote against tax cuts. He is weak on crime. Weak on borders. He is strong on raising your taxes. He is terrible for property owners.\"\n@highlight\nWalter Shaub filed an official complaint against Conway\n@highlight\nEarlier this year Conway got in trouble for plugging Ivanka Trump's clothing and accessory line",

But as she held him, the two militants at the door shot him three times - in his right arm, his neck and his heart. His crime? Before ISIS arrived in Mosul in June 2014, he had worked as a policeman. Fitha's mother Foza Motaab is not sure if her little girl will ever recover. She is, she says, 'psychologically damaged'.\n@highlight\nFitha hugged her father Khamis Faris as he was shot dead by ISIS\n@highlight\nThe Islamic militants murdered him because he had been a police officer\n@highlight\nFitha and her family are now living in a refugee camp near Erbil with thousands of other people fleeing the evils of ISIS in their home countries\n@highlight\nEach family has their own shocking story of trauma to contend with",

Original story: Kim Davis has a secret admirer. Someone -- a member of Congress, more specifically -- invited the controversial county court clerk from Kentucky to the State of the Union address, but she's not saying who. Davis was briefly jailed last year when she refused to issue marriage licenses following the Supreme Court's landmark decision creating a nationwide right to wed to same-sex couples. A representative for Davis's lawyers at a group called Liberty Counsel would not disclose who invited the Rowan County clerk, but did include her seat number.\n@highlight\nRowan County, Kentucky, Clerk Kim Davis will attend the State of the Union address\n@highlight\nDavis was briefly jailed last year when she refused to issue marriage licenses",

It’s not an obvious one for the fans, just like it would not be an obvious one for fans in France to sing God Save The Queen, because they don’t know the words. Symbolically it’s a very nice gesture.’ There are 72 French players at top-flight clubs, the biggest number from a single nationality after England, and a choral version of La Marseillaise will be played after the coin toss, with players from both teams joining officials in the centre circle facing the main stand.\n@highlight\nLa Marseillaise will be heard across Premier League grounds this weekend\n@highlight\nFrench national anthem will be played in tribute to victims of Paris attacks\n@highlight\nArsene Wenger, Roberto Martinez and Ronald Koeman welcomed gesture\n@highlight\nFootball League has also given teams the option to do so this weekend too\n@highlight\nSee full coverage of news and results from the Premier League",

At his victory party, Moore said he'd spoken Tuesday night with Sens. Mike Lee of Utah, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas. He also offered a national audience a glimpse of his religious-themed rhetoric. \"We have to return the knowledge of God and the Constitution of the United States to the United States Congress,\" Moore said.\n@highlight\nSen.

A senior Pakistani government official told CNN that Gadahn was arrested Sunday in Karachi, and a second senior Pakistani government official later confirmed the arrest. But a U.S. intelligence official said there appears to be no validity to the reports that Gadahn was in custody, and other U.S. officials also said they have no indication that Gadahn has been captured. Reports of the arrest came hours after Islamist Web sites posted video of Gadahn praising the November massacre at Fort Hood, Texas. On the video, Gadahn said the U.S. Army major charged with gunning down 13 people \"lit a path\" for other Muslim service members to follow.\n@highlight\nNEW: Two Pakistani officials say Gadahn arrested; U.S. intelligence official casts doubt\n@highlight\nReport of arrest comes hour after video of U.S.-born Gadahn surfaces\n@highlight\nGadahn praises November massacre at Fort Hood, Texas, in video\n@highlight\nIn 2006, Gadahn was indicted for treason and providing material support to terrorists",

                "text" : "(CNN) -- CNN Pentagon Correspondent Barbara Starr reported Thursday that the U.S. intelligence community has information that Russian artillery is firing into eastern Ukraine. The artillery pieces shown in the released footage are Russian M-46 130mm field guns with a range of a little over 16 miles. Why would the Russians do this? Simple -- this fits into their plan to support pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. The end game? I believe it is the eventual absorption of that region into the Russian Federation. The area in red on the map is where much of the fighting between the Ukrainian government and the pro-Russian rebels has been occurring over the last month. The separatists have downed several Ukrainian military aircraft in this area as the fighting raged. It is also the area in which Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down in what most of us believe was a tragic case of mistaken identity and inept use of modern weaponry.\n@highlight\nU.S. intelligence officials say they believe Russian artillery is firing into eastern Ukraine\n@highlight\nRick Francona says the artillery firing is a significant escalation by the Russians\n@highlight\nHe says Vladimir Putin's concern is to protect the pro-Russian rebels\n@highlight\nFrancona: Ultimately, Putin may claim territory in eastern Ukraine to 'protect' rebels",

The back-to-back British title holder's jaguar of choice Ma-Tzu, of course, has four legs instead of four wheels and calls Mexico City's Black Jaguar White Tiger Foundation home. And thanks to the sanctuary, Ma-Tzu will be around longer than F1's Jaguar Racing, which lasted from 2000 to 2004 after being formed by Ford's purchase of Jackie Stewart's and never won a race. Hamilton, who's preparing for the season's penultimate race in Brazil this weekend, says his time with Ma-Tzu was 'almost like' playing with with his beloved British bulldogs Roscoe and Coco, 'except much bigger'.\n@highlight\nLewis Hamilton put his arm in the mouth of Brazilian jaguar Ma-Tzu\n@highlight\nWorld champion visited Mexico's Black Jaguar White Tiger Foundation\n@highlight\nHe's posted images and video with the rescued big cats on social media\n@highlight\nThe sanctuary has named a newborn lion cub in his honour",

                "text" : "Washington (CNN) A battered Democratic Party has largely forfeited the fight on television over the fate of President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, another sign of both Gorsuch's political strength and of Democrats' inability to focus on fighting the pick. Just four days before Gorsuch appears before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democratic groups and committees have barely lifted an advertising finger in their quest to sink the nomination. At the same time, Republicans are waging an eight-figure advertising campaign that is growing daily, an effort centered on the states that Senate Democrats vulnerable in 2018 call home. Conservative and GOP-related groups have outspent Democrats on TV by more than $3 million, according to Democrats and Republicans tracking the advertising figures.\n@highlight\nDemocrats had spent just $180,000 on the television campaign vs. $3.3 million from Republicans\n@highlight\nSome liberals are making a late effort to bolster their paid media",

But in concluding the trial judge erred upon learning of the juror's social networking communication with a key prosecution witness, state justices unanimously decided a new trial may be necessary unless the state proves the juror shouldn't have been disqualified. \"If, for any reason, the trial court is unable to conduct a full and fair hearing with regard to juror (Glenn Scott) Mitchell's improper extrajudicial communication with Dr. Lewis, then the trial court shall grant Mr. Smith a new trial,\" the Supreme Court ruled, referring to the juror by name, as well as Dr. Adele Lewis, the medical examiner who testified.\n@highlight\nWilliam Darelle Smith went on trial in 2010 for first-degree murder\n@highlight\nA doctor who did the victim's autopsy testified, then was contacted by a juror\n@highlight\nThe trial judge didn't order a hearing into that interaction; high court says he erred\n@highlight\nState Supreme Court orders such a hearing, which could lead to a new trial",

He clearly reveres America's fighting men and women. He often boasts about their prowess, has surrounded himself with hard charging generals and has vowed to reinvent veterans' health care. But he's also been happy to use the military for his own political ends when it suits him. The latest episode -- in which Trump falsely claimed Barack Obama didn't call the families of dead soldiers -- is revealing because it shows how Trump lashes out whenever he believes his conduct or character is under attack. It's another case of him citing information that is either incorrect of unverified when he is on the defensive, a trait that often leads him into deeper political trouble.\n@highlight\nControversy over Obama calls not the first time Trump has politicized sacrifice\n@highlight\nPresident facing questions over ISIS ambush that killed four soldiers in Niger",

In the same time span, the administration said between 2,372 and 2,581 militants had been taken out by drones. The information was released as part of an effort by Obama to introduce more transparency into a controversial military tactic that he has defended as necessary to fight terror. Human rights groups, however, were unsatisfied by the government's disclosed figures, which came in far lower than independent estimates of civilian causalities. The numbers released Friday included deaths outside established war zones. The administration didn't specify which countries were included, though the military and CIA are believed to have carried out strikes in Pakistan, Yemen and various countries in Africa.\n@highlight\nPresident Barack Obama wants more transparency\n@highlight\nControversy over how the numbers are calculated",

We must not squander this chance.\" Yet having spent the better part of my adult professional life working to promote, facilitate and consummate negotiations between Arabs and Israelis, my advice is precisely the opposite of Mr. Carter's. I completely understand the urgent desire on the part of American peacemakers to do something. And in the case of Mr. Carter, that passion is especially strong. Few Israelis and Egyptians I know would take issue with the fact that had it not been for the role played by the US, led by President Jimmy Carter -- building on Anwar Sadat's historic visit and Menachem Begin's strong response -- there would have been no Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty in 1979.\n@highlight\nAaron Miller: Jimmy Carter's call for US to recognize the State of Palestine is a mistake\n@highlight\nKey to solving the Israel-Palestinian conflict does not rest in President Obama's hands, nor in those of his successor, he says",

Clinton joined Obama on stage after his speech, and the President and his 2008 primary rival clung together in a shared moment of symbolism: the nation's first African-American leader entrusting its future to the woman who could become its first female commander-in-chief. Obama was in Philadelphia at the Democratic National Convention 12 years to the day after he shook politics with a convention speech in Boston that encouraged Americans to look at the common threads that unite them. He offered a similarly empowering vision of the nation Wednesday, saying America doesn't need a \"self declared savior\" like Donald Trump to fix it.\n@highlight\nObama's speech sets up Hillary Clinton's address Thursday night\n@highlight\nHe capped an evening that included Vice President Joe Biden",

Rosenberg told TMZ she 'had very little time' to sketch from a distance in conditions that were a 'court artist's nightmare'.\n@highlight\nJane Rosenberg again sketched the quarterback's famous face and even got a wave of approval from Brady this time\n@highlight\nRosenberg's ghoulish first sketch of Brady was widely ridiculed",

That could be a key question in the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 crash investigation, as officials try to determine what was responsible for Thursday's plane crash in volatile eastern Ukraine.

Trump's jaunt to Mar-a-Lago, his seventh since taking office in January, coincides with a closely watched anniversary in North Korea, where analysts have said the rogue regime may be preparing for a sixth nuclear test. It wouldn't be the first time Trump confronted a global incident from the confines of his terra-cotta-roofed oceanfront mansion. During a visit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe earlier this year, North Korea test fired ballistic missiles, prompting an impromptu strategy session on Mar-a-Lago's dining patio. Last weekend, as Trump was hosting Chinese President Xi Jinping, he announced US missile strikes from Mar-a-Lago after conferring with top aides in a specially designed conference room.\n@highlight\nThis is Trump's seventh trip to Mar-a-Lago since taking office\n@highlight\nTrump previously hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping at the resort",

In a series of recent interviews fleshing out his foreign policy in the wake of the Brussels attacks, the Republican front-runner has questioned the modern relevance of U.S. alliances that have underpinned security in Europe and Asia since World War II. Donald Trump unveils foreign policy advisers He's suggested using economic warfare to halt China's territorial moves in the South China Sea and raised the prospect of a fundamental reconsideration of nuclear doctrine by musing about South Korea and Japan acquiring their own atomic arsenal. He says the U.S. should boycott Saudi Arabian oil if the kingdom doesn't send ground troops to fight ISIS and believes NATO is an anachronism. And he warns he will renegotiate bedrock free trade deals, a prospect that could send serious reverberations through the global economy.\n@highlight\nTrump believes NATO is an anachronism\n@highlight\nAnd he's a staunch free trade opponent",

The rule, which was finalized under President Barack Obama in November, would require oil and gas companies to actively plug leaks of natural gas while scaling back their practice of intentionally venting or burning the gas in order to extract more profitable crude oil. The drilling industry, however, supported Republicans' efforts to overturn the rule, saying it would undo the costly regulation, which is viewed as a threat to jobs and operations.\n@highlight\nEnvironmentalists get rare win to keep Obama-era regulation\n@highlight\nRollback of rule aimed to lessen regulations on natural gas producers",

Here's how we split the clubs: South Arsenal, Aston Villa, Chelsea, Crystal Palace, Leicester City, QPR, Southampton, Swansea City, Spurs, West Brom, West Ham United North Burnley, Everton, Hull City, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Newcastle United, Stoke City, Sunderland North vs South. It is perhaps the fiercest argument between the people of England.\n@highlight\nNo place for Diego Costa or Olivier Giroud as Harry Kane leads the line\n@highlight\nSouthampton and Chelsea - the Premier League's meanest defences - make up the entire back seven of our Southern XI\n@highlight\nEden Hazard and Alexis Sanchez will play with Santi Cazorla behind Kane\n@highlight\nWe'll test who is better with help from Football Manager",

This is the first time either name has cracked the list of most popular names. The lists for boys and girls haven't changed much, with only a few shifts up and down. Perhaps Charlotte, a newcomer to the list last year, is a more popular name after the birth of British royal baby Princess Charlotte Elizabeth Diana in May 2015.

Pat McCrory said. \"People are playing golf 20 miles from here, and yet we have a whole town under water.\" The aftermath of Matthew's deluge has caused normally tranquil rivers to swell to record levels.

A 'Parexit' would send a clear signal to the rest of the world: 'The United States does not care about the global problems of human-caused climate change. You are on your own,'\" the group wrote on the website responsiblescientists.org.

On Wednesday, Russia's Ministry of Defense announced it killed the terror leader on the ministry's official Facebook page. It said Adnani was one of up to 40 ISIS militants killed by a Russian bomber in Aleppo province. But a US defense official slammed Russia's assertion. \"It would be laughable but for the very real humanitarian suffering Russia has inflicted,\" the defense official said Wednesday. \"We stand by the statement we made yesterday. We conducted a strike that targeted al-Adnani. We are assessing the results of that strike.\"\n@highlight\nA drone controlled by the US targeted ISIS leader, US defense officials told CNN\n@highlight\nUS official: Russia's claim would be \"laughable\" if it weren't for \"humanitarian suffering Russia has inflicted\"\n@highlight\nMohammad al-Adnani had urged lone-wolf attacks against countries launching strikes against ISIS",

Pakistan's economy is in free fall, and its major cities are wracked by political violence, while Pakistani attitudes toward the United States have never been worse -- a legacy of the CIA contractor who shot and killed two Pakistanis in the city of Lahore this year, the campaign of drone attacks in Pakistan's tribal regions and the unilateral American raid to kill Osama bin Laden in northern Pakistan in May. On the U.S. side, there is considerable anger about Pakistan's unwillingness or inability to constrain Taliban groups based on its territory that are killing American soldiers in Afghanistan and a perception that while U.S. aid flows in large amounts to Pakistan, it continues to harbor enemies of America.\n@highlight\nPakistani-U.S. relations are at their lowest ebb, authors say\n@highlight\nSome argue that there needs to be a cooling-off period to calm tempers\n@highlight\nAuthors: Both nations should craft a new plan to change the game\n@highlight\nJoint anti-terror operations and new trade policies would help, they say",

The 54-44 vote on strict party lines came after Senate Democrats pushed through an amendment to restore funding for Obamacare that House Republicans had eliminated in their version of the spending measure, which would prevent the start of a government shutdown on Tuesday. Now House Speaker John Boehner must decide whether to urge his divided Republican caucus to vote with Democrats to pass the Senate plan, or yield again to a hardline conservative wing that demands making continued government funding contingent on undermining Obamacare.\n@highlight\nNEW: President Obama criticizes Republican tactics on shutdown, debt ceiling\n@highlight\nThe Senate sends the House a revised spending plan to avoid a shutdown\n@highlight\nSenate Democrats restore funding for Obamacare opposed by Republicans\n@highlight\nHouse Speaker John Boehner faces a showdown with tea party conservatives",

We've seen reports of the pro-Russian thugs shooting women and children, cynically calling it a \"protection of the Russian-speaking population.\" The price we are paying to bring peace back to the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine is too high. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has proposed the decentralization of power as part of his peace plan. It means more freedom, more economic autonomy and more opportunities to use languages spoken in a particular community for every region.\n@highlight\nPavlo Klimkin: With downing of MH17, price of peace in eastern Ukraine already too high\n@highlight\nKlimkin: Ukrainians know bitterness of loss, share grief with families of the deceased\n@highlight\nHe says the guilty must be promptly punished",

The move rankled some on Twitter who argued the North Carolina Republican was singling out Harris, one of three women on the intelligence panel, during Wednesday's contentious hearing. Harris was pressing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein over whether he would sign a letter to give Special Counsel Robert Mueller full independence from the Justice Department in his probe, which would have the same effect as a letter issued for then-Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald in the investigation into the 2003 leaking of then-covert CIA officer Valerie Plame's identity.\n@highlight\nSen.

CNN has obtained sections of that 300-page appeal, including the defense argument that the trial judge erred by not allowing the testimony of Dr. Arnold Klein, a dermatologist the defense contended addicted Jackson to Demerol in his last weeks. Murray's appeal, which will be filed Monday, also argues that prosecutors never proved Jackson was hooked up to an IV drip of the drug that killed him. The defense theory was that Jackson had administered the fatal dosage himself while the doctor was away.\n@highlight\nMurray calls from jail citing \"injustice\" done to appeal lawyer\n@highlight\nAppeal lawyer Valerie Wass \" took a personal hit for me,\" Murray tells CNN\n@highlight\nMurray witnessed Wass and trial lawyer Michael Flanagan argue at the jail\n@highlight\nWass will file Murray's appeal on Monday",

Conservatives wanted one of their own on Romney's ticket and they got that in Ryan, who has emerged as their ideological leader on the Hill on fiscal and budget matters. The choice also helps satisfy Republican strategists who felt Romney needed to not only stress how President Barack Obama has failed in that role, but also better articulate what the GOP candidate would do if elected. \"Ryan is a great choice. He energizes an already motivated party to a further degree and will help clarify the differing visions between the two campaigns for the country,\" said Phil Musser, a GOP strategist who in 2007 was a senior adviser to Romney's presidential campaign. \"There are big choices, and in making the selection, Romney is showing that he believes America is ready for the choice.\"\n@highlight\nBoth sides got what they wanted in Mitt Romney's choice of Paul Ryan as his running mate\n@highlight\nConservatives celebrate Ryan's selection; choice helps shore up some support for Romney\n@highlight\nDemocrats quick to attack Ryan's selection as proof of Romney's conservative vision\n@highlight\nPolitical experts say both sides will battle over how to introduce Ryan to American public",

Gadhafi was killed after being captured last week, and the circumstances of his death remain unclear. Human Rights Watch says dozens of apparent reprisal killings also occurred on both sides. Such violence can be common in the aftermath of a long dictatorship, when desired and even cathartic revenge against oppressors competes with efforts to establish the rule of law and stability. Is the mayhem committed with seeming impunity an unavoidable result of revolution, or does it reveal inherent instability in a society damaged by decades of unjust, corrupt and oppressive rule?\n@highlight\nHuman Rights Watch calls for investigations of apparent reprisal killings\n@highlight\n\"The aftermath of a very brutal dictatorship is usually very ugly,\" an analyst says\n@highlight\n\"A revolution is not a tea party,\" China's Mao Tse-tung said\n@highlight\nLike Gadhafi, other dictators also have met inglorious ends",

The presumptive Republican nominee's search for a running mate revealed the intense and increasing role of three of his adult children, Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka Trump, along with his son-in-law Jared Kushner, in the billionaire's unorthodox political operation. Trump offered the vice presidential slot to Indiana Gov. Mike Pence Wednesday, CNN has learned, and the Indiana governor accepted. Sources said that Trump's decision to pick Pence over more controversial candidates such as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie followed a sustained behind-the-scenes lobbying push orchestrated from within the family's inner circle.\n@highlight\nTrump family led push for Pence\n@highlight\nDonald Jr., Eric and Ivanka to play key convention role\n@highlight\nSon-in-law Jared Kushner also a key player",

Bobby Jindal got involved in the \"Duck Dynasty\" controversy Thursday by tweeting his response to A&E's decision to suspend Phil Robertson for his inflammatory remarks in a recent GQ interview. \"I remember when TV networks believed in the First Amendment,\" he wrote, adding, \"it is a messed up situation when Miley Cyrus gets a laugh, and Phil Robertson gets suspended.\" The truth is it is a messed up situation when a governor rumored to have his sights on the presidency doesn't understand the breadth of the First Amendment. The Federal Communications Commission did not send officials into the office of Nancy Dubuc, president of A&E Networks. The FBI did not threaten to put Robertson away, and the Internal Revenue Service didn't freeze his bank accounts.\n@highlight\n\"Duck Dynasty\" star suspended due to controversial remarks in GQ interview\n@highlight\nLZ Granderson says it's a mistake to say the TV network is violating First Amendment\n@highlight\nFirst Amendment stops government from limiting free speech, he notes\n@highlight\nGranderson: Constitution doesn't prevent society from responding to hateful speech",

'We want to congratulate the Israeli people for the democratic process – for the election that they just engaged in, with all the parties that engaged in that election,' Simas had said.

Carter's positive test means Bolt must return one of his nine Olympic gold medals. The 30-year-old Bolt cemented his status as an all-time great by completing an unprecedented 'triple triple' in Rio 2016, becoming the only man to win all three sprint events at three Olympic Games. But the gold the Jamaican won in the 4x100m relay in Beijing 2008 will no longer count after governing body the International Olympic Committee (IOC) disqualified the Caribbean island's sprint team Wednesday. Re-analysis of Carter's samples from Beijing resulted in a positive test for the prohibited substance methylhexaneamine.\n@highlight\nBolt stripped of 2008 Olympic sprint relay gold\n@highlight\nTeammate Nesta Carter fails drug test\n@highlight\nJamaican Bolt no longer holds 'triple triple'",

Arguing that the two-state solution is dying and that something must be done to keep hope alive, Carter wrote: \"I fear for the spirit of Camp David. We must not squander this chance.\" Yet having spent the better part of my adult professional life working to promote, facilitate and consummate negotiations between Arabs and Israelis, my advice is precisely the opposite of Mr. Carter's. I completely understand the urgent desire on the part of American peacemakers to do something. And in the case of Mr. Carter, that passion is especially strong. Few Israelis and Egyptians I know would take issue with the fact that had it not been for the role played by the US, led by President Jimmy Carter -- building on Anwar Sadat's historic visit and Menachem Begin's strong response -- there would have been no Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty in 1979.\n@highlight\nAaron Miller: Jimmy Carter's call for US to recognize the State of Palestine is a mistake\n@highlight\nKey to solving the Israel-Palestinian conflict does not rest in President Obama's hands, nor in those of his successor, he says",

Catalans coach Laurent Frayssinous decided to rest a number of players ahead of Thursday's Challenge Cup tie against Hull KR and the decision almost back-fired. The hosts were in danger of throwing away a 12-0 half-time lead as Wakefield, with Jacob Miller kept in the full-back spot as they looked to win their first game in 16 matches, fighting back to level before a late burst condemned them to another defeat. Despite taking a 12-point lead after 10 minutes, the home side's indiscipline cost them the opportunity to extend that lead.\n@highlight\nCatalans coach Laurent Frayssinous decided to rest a number of players ahead of Thursday's Challenge Cup tie against Hull KR\n@highlight\nBen Pomeroy opened the scoring for the hosts\n@highlight\nDebutant Krisnan Inu scored a superb individual try in the 10th minute",

His death led to days of demonstrations including some that turned violent. They wanted justice for a black man who they felt lost his life due to excessive police force. On Wednesday, a more subdued scene played out following the announcement that Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department Officer Brentley Vinson would not be charged for fatally shooting the 43-year-old man in an apartment complex parking lot. The decision concluded a two-month long investigation into whether the shooting was justified.\n@highlight\nFour protesters arrested Wednesday night\n@highlight\nScott family attorney: We still have concerns and questions\n@highlight\nScott's DNA was found on the grip of a gun found at the scene, DA says",

Family members have said that the man in the video, who uses the alias Abu Dajana Al-Khorasani, is al-Balawi. A much shorter version of the video was posted online in January. The December 30 bombing at a U.S. base in Khost, in southeastern Afghanistan, killed seven CIA operatives and a Jordanian army captain. The video posted Saturday is dated \"Safar 1431\" on the lunar calendar, which includes any day between January 16, 2010 and February 13, 2010.\n@highlight\nHumam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi has been ID'd as bomber who killed 7 CIA agents\n@highlight\nNewly released video shows al-Balawi describing what led to suicide attack\n@highlight\nHe says CIA team was not original target, but \"a gift from God,\" who sent \"valuable prey\"\n@highlight\nAl-Balawi says in video he fooled Jordanian officials into thinking he worked for them",

At first, it appeared that U.S. diplomats and the Chinese government brokered a deal that satisfied Chen and everyone involved. But now Chen says he wants to leave China, and that he feels unsafe. Has the Obama administration bungled his case? Did President Barack Obama use people who were capable of correctly interpreting the signals in China? Or was there a gap in translation? Possible breakthrough for blind activist We learned earlier this week that Chen was released from the U.S. Embassy with the Chinese government's assurance of his \"safety\" and a promise to facilitate his study of law in an unspecified place outside his home province of Shandong. It sounded like a win-win solution. But those who have intimate knowledge of China and its political system had reasons to worry.\n@highlight\nThe deal the U.S. and China made over Chen Guangcheng appears to be unraveling\n@highlight\nYang Su: Has the Obama administration bungled his case?\n@highlight\nHe says the deal was almost made to be broken because the U.S. made false assumptions\n@highlight\nSu: U.S. will have more success in negotiating with China if it recruits more Chinese experts",

For Delta, the deal provides access to a market that, though lucrative, has been difficult for them to crack. \"Heathrow is the most important destination for the U.S. business traveler, and we've not been able to provide the global frequency that our customers need,\" admits Edward Bastian, Delta's president. \"Virgin was the best way to get to them.\"\n@highlight\nDelta takes 49% stake in Virgin Atlantic\n@highlight\nAirlines hope that codeshare will increase their trans-Atlantic success\n@highlight\nUK-U.S. routes are the most world's busiest and lucrative\n@highlight\nVirgin seen as a much more niche airline than Delta",

An announcement is expected this week, and the services would have six months to assess the impact of the change and work out the details, the officials said Monday. Military chiefs wanted time to methodically work through the legal, medical and administrative issues and develop training to ease any transition, and senior leaders believed six months would be sufficient. The officials said Defense Secretary Ash Carter has asked his personnel undersecretary, Brad Carson, to set up a working group of senior military and civilian leaders to take an objective look at the issue.\n@highlight\nPentagon leaders are finalizing plans to formally end one of the last sexuality-based barriers to military service\n@highlight\nA concerns involved in the repeal of the ban includes whether the military would conduct or pay for the medical costs of gender transitioning\n@highlight\nThe military wants at least six months to tackle questions about where transgender troops would be housed and what bathrooms they'd use\n@highlight\nThe transgender issue first arose when security leaker Chelsea Manning, arrested as Bradley Manning, requested hormone therapy behind bars",

The unnamed storm was first detected in the Atlantic on August 27, reaching Cuba as a tropical storm on September 3. Like Ike, the hurricane crossed Cuba and entered the Gulf of Mexico, crashing ashore just south of Galveston on September 8. Galveston Island was completely covered by 8- to 16-foot storm tides. Estimates of the death toll range from 6,000 to 12,000, and property damage was estimated at $30 million.\n@highlight\nCategory 4 storm destroyed Galveston in 1900\n@highlight\nEstimates of the death toll range from 6,000 to 12,000\n@highlight\nResidents ignored early storm warnings\n@highlight\nComplete destruction kept word from the outside world",

Guided by a platoon of pacing runners, the three started together, but Kipchoge -- the 2016 Olympic champion and the 2016 London Marathon winner -- came closest in the end. The marathon was held at the Monza Formula 1 racetrack near Milan, Italy, a site chosen because it was built for speed.

Every step of her 2016 campaign -- from her embrace of the historic nature of her candidacy to her more personal connections with voters -- seems to be an acknowledgment that she's learned the lessons of her failed campaign eight years earlier. The efforts may be working. A national Washington Post/ABC News poll released Sunday found her leading Trump 51%-39% while a Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey found her five points ahead. Clinton leads Trump, pair of polls show Clinton still faces huge challenges. She is dogged by the controversy surrounding her use of a personal email server as secretary of state and has struggled with the perception that she's dishonest. Perhaps most notably, she has to figure out how to prevail in a year when major blocs of both parties are attracted to outsider candidates like Trump --and are weary of political dynasties.\n@highlight\nEvery step of Clinton's campaign seems to be an acknowledgment that she's learned lessons from 2008\n@highlight\nNational polls released over the weekend show Clinton leading Trump",

Both Parliament and the prime minister have greater powers under the new constitution, while the monarch's sway has been slightly lessened. More than 300 international observers monitored the voting, alongside 3,500 Moroccan observers, the semiofficial Le Matin newspaper reported. Morocco's moderate Islamist Justice and Development Party (PJD) is expected to do well in the vote.

Throughout his campaign, Trump has promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, which mandates that insurers in the health insurance marketplace provide coverage for all FDA-approved birth control methods, including IUDs, with no copayment or coinsurance when provided in-network. Repealing the act is also a \"high item on the list\" for Trump's Republican colleagues, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday.

The 153-page ruling from the International Court of Justice means that modern-day Serbia will not have to pay restitution to Croatia, which in 1991 split from what was then Yugoslavia. The decision relates only to the two national governments' responsibility to one another, not the culpability of any individuals for targeting members of an ethnic group. Such individual cases are handled by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), another U.N. court. \"Croatia has not established that the only reasonable inference that can be drawn from the (Serbians') pattern of conduct ... was the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, the Croat group,\" the International Court of Justice (or ICJ) ruled. \"... It follows ... Croatia has failed to substantiate its allegation that genocide was committed.\"\n@highlight\nA U.N. court finds that Serbian forces did commit large-scale killings, other violent acts\n@highlight\nBut there's not enough evidence showing intent to commit genocide, the court rules\n@highlight\nThe same court dismisses Serbia's counterclaim that Croatia committed genocide",

A recent study estimates that roughly 2.6 billion people in the region and Africa could be at risk of contracting the virus, which has been linked to the neurological disorder microcephaly in unborn babies. It's not yet clear why Zika has spread so suddenly in Singapore. Many of the cases are thought to be locally-transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. On Saturday, Singapore's Ministry of Health said analysis of two cases found they had likely evolved from a strain of Zika that was already circulating in Southeast Asia. Malaysia confirmed its first case of Zika infection in a 58-year-old woman -- who had visited her daughter in Singapore -- on September 1. The country reported its first locally-transmitted case on September 3, with authorities expecting more to come.\n@highlight\nSurge in Zika cases in Singapore has raised concerns in the region\n@highlight\nA new study shows that 2.6 billion people across Asia and Africa could be at risk",

Several senior U.S. officials said 44-year-old Abu Wa'el Dhiab, a Syrian national, went off the radar several weeks ago from Uruguay, where he was resettled in 2014 after being released. Uruguayan officials said he traveled to Brazil, but Brazilian officials told CNN they have no record of Dhiab having legally entered their country. Avianca Brazil Airlines issued an alert warning employees that Dhiab may try to fly using a fake passport, a representative from the airline told CNN. An image of the alert, first published by the Argentine web news portal Infobae, says the information came from Brazil's anti-terrorism police.\n@highlight\nConcern that he's headed to the Olympics\n@highlight\nAirline issues alert he may try to use fake passport",

Last week, hundreds of conservative evangelicals gathered in Alabama to engage in a reasonable, respectful discourse on immigration. You read that right. Less than a year after Alabama enacted the strictest immigration law in the land, evangelical students, pastors and national faith leaders gathered at Samford University in Birmingham for \"a Christ-centered conversation on immigration\" called the G92 South Immigration Conference. Following the example of Cedarville University's inaugural G92 gathering last fall in Ohio, evangelical Christians gathered in Birmingham to discuss immigration through the prism of the Bible. Instead of listening to partisan sound bites, participants looked to the word of God -- specifically the 92 references to \"ger,\" the word for \"stranger,\" in the Old Testament alone.\n@highlight\nEvangelical students, pastors, faith leaders gathered for conference on immigration\n@highlight\nAli Noorani says discourse was reasonable and respectful\n@highlight\nLeaders saw responsibility to feed the hungry without regard to immigration status, he says\n@highlight\nNoorani: Americans want reasonable, humane solutions to immigration problems",

A recent study estimates that roughly 2.6 billion people in the region and Africa could be at risk of contracting the virus, which has been linked to the neurological disorder microcephaly in unborn babies. It's not yet clear why Zika has spread so suddenly in Singapore. Many of the cases are thought to be locally-transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. On Saturday, Singapore's Ministry of Health said analysis of two cases found they had likely evolved from a strain of Zika that was already circulating in Southeast Asia. Malaysia confirmed its first case of Zika infection in a 58-year-old woman -- who had visited her daughter in Singapore -- on September 1. The country reported its first locally-transmitted case on September 3, with authorities expecting more to come.\n@highlight\nSurge in Zika cases in Singapore has raised concerns in the region\n@highlight\nA new study shows that 2.6 billion people across Asia and Africa could be at risk",

AB 2888 passed the state Assembly Monday by a unanimous 66-0 vote. It is headed to Gov. Jerry Brown's desk. Lawmakers proposed the measure in June in response to the outcome in the former Stanford swimmer's trial. Turner was sentenced to six months in jail and three years of probation for sexually assaulting a 23-year-old unconscious woman in 2015 behind a trash bin on the university's campus. Critics condemned the sentence from Santa Clara County Judge Aaron Persky as too lenient, leading to efforts to recall Persky and change sentencing laws for sexual assault.\n@highlight\nBill proposes prison sentences in cases where victim is unconscious or intoxicated\n@highlight\nIt now goes to Gov.

Obama sat on one side, between the late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and Facebook pioneer Mark Zuckerberg, but the place of honor was no accident. Google executives and employees donated more than $1.6 million to Obama's two White House campaigns, and the online search giant parachuted top talent into both. One result has been a coziness with the U.S. government's executive branch that few other companies can match – marked by access for lobbyists, mentions in nearly half of Obama's State of the Union addresses, and a personnel feeder trough serving the White House with new senior hires.\n@highlight\nGoogle employees donated $1.6 million to President Barack Obama's two White House bids\n@highlight\nThe company told Daily Mail Online that it has spoken with the Federal Trade Commission about antitrust concerns; it was investigated in 2011 but later let off the hook\n@highlight\nIn the 2012 election, the company’s search algorithm customized results for Obama but not for Republican Mitt Romney\n@highlight\nGoogle execs who have left to work in the White House include Obama's chief technology officer\n@highlight\nHillary Clinton also poached her new tech chief from Google this week",

In the fallen leader's hometown of Sirte, along the Mediterranean coast, anti-Gadhafi fighters pulled back Friday night after a day of chaotic, fierce street fighting. The number of casualties was unclear. A brigade of fighters from Misrata wrested control of the Al-Gurdabia military base and a civilian airport near the western edge of Sirte, according to the Misrata Military Council. Ali Gheliwan, a spokesman to the Misrata Military Council, said seven anti-Gadhafi fighters were killed and 31 wounded in Friday's fighting in Sirte.\n@highlight\n\"We have the equipment and the weaponry\" for a long war, says man identified as Gadhafi spokesman\n@highlight\nSecurity Council passes resolution establishing support mission\n@highlight\nSirte, Sabha and Bani Walid are the last loyalist strongholds\n@highlight\nA Libyan delegation in Niger demands the return of Saadi Gadhafi",

                "text" : "Jose Mourinho's Chelsea side have made a shocking start to the season, losing three of their opening five games while looking like a pale imitation of the 2014-15 Premier League champions. Their latest embarrassment came at Goodison Park on Saturday as a Steven Naismith hat-trick condemned Mourinho's side to the lower reaches of the Premier League table. So, ahead of their Champions League clash against Maccabi Tel Aviv, Sportsmail asks 10 questions facing Mourinho as he aims to pull his side out of a hole. Despite his history with Arsenal, Fabregas quickly became a fan-favourite last season as he laid on goal after goal during the early stages of Chelsea's 2014-15 title winning season. However, Blues fans will tell you it's been far too long since the Spaniard had even a half-decent game.\n@highlight\nChelsea suffered third defeat of the season against Everton on Saturday\n@highlight\nBlues have conceded more goals than any other team so far this season\n@highlight\nJose Mourinho insists he still has faith in his 'champions'\n@highlight\nSeveral Chelsea players are struggling to recapture their form",

England centre Shenton's clinical finishing proved decisive as the Tigers recovered from 12-0 down after just five minutes. Luke Gale, who scored a try and landed six goals, was also an important contributor as the Tigers avenged two defeats against Hull this season. Hull failed to build on their flying start as their top-four hopes faded with a defeat that left them six points drift of Castleford and Huddersfield, who are now level on 28 points. Former Leeds Rhinos and Wakefield Wildcats hooker Paul McShane made his Castleford debut and loose-forward Nathan Massey returned after missing three matches with an ankle injury.\n@highlight\nLuke Gale scored a try and landed six goals for the home side\n@highlight\nFormer Leeds Rhinos hooker Paul McShane made his Castleford debut\n@highlight\nHull welcomed back centre Setaimata Sa after several weeks out injured",

The 27-year-old beat Wladimir Klitschko in Germany in one of the biggest upsets in heavyweight history with a unanimous points decision on Saturday to claim the WBA, WBO and IBF titles. Fury dressed as Batman in the run-up to the fight and was involved in verbal spats with Klitschko, labelling him boring and robotic as well as saying he was only interested in breaking his face. He also sang Aerosmith's 'I Don't Want To Miss A Thing' in the ring after victory in Dusseldorf and made homophobic remarks in a newspaper interview in the build-up to the fight, but former heavyweight champion Lewis has warned Fury he is now a role model.\n@highlight\nTyson Fury beat Wladimir Klitschko by unanimous points decision\n@highlight\nFury triumphed in Germanry to claim the WBA, WBO and IBF titles\n@highlight\nEx-WBA champion David Haye  is coming out of retirement in January",

On February 19, a federal appeals court ordered a hearing to determine whether the Pentagon infringed on a patent owned by Zoltek, a materials company from St. Louis, when it developed the stealthy coating for the F-22 fighter plane and B-2 bomber. In the latest development in a case that has spanned nearly 20 years, the ruling reversed a Federal Claims Court judge's 2014 decision that sided with the U.S. government by determining that Zoltek's patent was invalid.\n@highlight\nLawyers are still arguing over the origins of stealth technology used on two U.S. military aircraft\n@highlight\nCourt ordered hearing to determine whether the Pentagon infringed on a patent owned by Zoltek\n@highlight\nZoltek was granted a patent in 1988 for a method of making products more resistant to electricity",

Following his meeting, Stone said he had a \"frank exchange\" and described the preceding as \"an entirely political exercise.\" Stone said he denied any Russian collusion or knowledge of the hacking of John Podesta's email during the roughly three-hour closed-door session.\n@highlight\nFormer Trump adviser Roger Stone has said he wants to testify publicly\n@highlight\nStone's own words have turned him into a lightning-rod",

Here, the Sportsmail columnist discusses four ways Chelsea can try to stop the Spanish playmaker Against West Brom, Silva played centrally just behind the striker. That is his most dangerous position. He can dribble at the heart of the opposition, pull the defence out of shape or thread passes inside the full backs to release Raheem Sterling and Jesus Navas.\n@highlight\nManchester City face Chelsea in Premier League clash at Etihad Stadium\n@highlight\nChelsea have tough task in keeping playmaker David Silva quiet on Sunday\n@highlight\nHe can dribble at the heart of the opposition and pull defences out of shape\n@highlight\nSilva loves to operate in front of back four, Jose Mourinho must stop him\n@highlight\nNemanja Matic is fine defensive midfielder but he can’t stop City by himself\n@highlight\nMourinho should consider playing Kurt Zouma, who is a beast of a player",

We need democratic elections. The (Muslim) Brotherhood needs to get off the streets and back into the political arena and fight your differences there, and we need to put Egypt back to work.

Now Al-Shabaab members and sources within the Somali army suggest the invitation will be accepted and the group - which commands around 9,000 fighters - will soon extend ISIS's self-proclaimed caliphate to east-Africa. The decision comes at a time when many of Al-Shabaab's local and foreign leaders are being killed by commando raids and drone strikes, the group is rapidly losing territory and its money is running out as a result.\n@highlight\nAl-Shabaab's top commanders held a secret meeting in Somalia this week\n@highlight\nSenior militant told MailOnline that pledge of allegiance to ISIS is imminent\n@highlight\nIslamic State courted Al-Shabaab in a propaganda video released in March\n@highlight\nThe alliance would extend ISIS's self-proclaimed caliphate to east Africa\n@highlight\nSomali terror group has ramped up violence 'in anticipation of the merger' and carried out 150 ambushes on military checkpoints in June",

Dressed in body armor and carrying two handguns, Loyd tried to flee out a back door and then the front. Mina says Loyd resisted arrest and was injured when police used force.\n@highlight\nMarkeith Loyd faces charges of murder, attempted murder, aggravated assault\n@highlight\nHe is accused of killing his ex-girlfriend and a police officer",

They are currently in the small town of Saint-Laurent-de-Cerdans in the south of France following camps in Marcoussis, south of Paris, and in Tignes in the French Alps where mountain climbing, hiking and cycling were the order of the day. The current camp is more rugby focussed for the France squad which has just slipped to seventh in the world rankings but is a notorious hand full for top rugby nations at World Cups with their last effort an agonising one-point short of victory in the final over New Zealand.\n@highlight\nEngland play France home and away before World Cup squad is confirmed\n@highlight\nTwickenham match on Saturday follows some intense training camps\n@highlight\nPhilippe Saint-Andre's side are now training in Saint-Laurent-de-Cerdans\n@highlight\nEngland 2015: CLICK HERE for all the latest Rugby World Cup news",
